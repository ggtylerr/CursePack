# Separable Doors
Adds several new entities

```
mod-id: cursepack-entities
```

Notes:
* Spectator cams are bugged (and will likely remain like that)
* There's no flashing whenever the creepig is about to explode
* You can ride the pigper, but the saddle doesn't show up and you sit on it's... torso? Yeah, that actually sounds normal.
* Accidentally left in mixin. Will probably remove it in like v1.1 or something.
